# World_Market_Data_Analysis (WMDA)

[In-Depth Project Overview and Background](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-data-science-analytics-consulting-project-overview-c35739820b5c)

## Compare different countries across a wide variety of features, over time

### Intended Perspective:  **A consultant advising a Tech client on Market Entry/Expansion**
> "Tech" is very broadly defined here as anywhere from a componenet manufacturer, or software development company*


### Data Overview
- Data collected from WorldBank, consisting of over 45 countries, with 75 features, across 25 years

- Language utilized:   **Python**

- Semi-large dataset

- **Unsupervised** in that features and countries are labeled, but there is ***No Given Target Feature***

### End Goal
- Display tangibility of Python utilization
- Focus is that of a consulting use-case, wherein Market Entry/Attractiveness will be the underlying goal
- Utilize the versatility of Python to reach insights that will contibute to the consultant's decision making and client direction.

### Modeling Principle
- **Heavily** clean and organize the data in several ways
- Apply Machine Learning (Unsupervised) where possible
- Implement redundancy to display alternative approaches whenever convenient
- Avoid Pipelines (as irritating as that may be)
> this is intentinoally ineffecient and visual for those less familiar with Python and Data Science

### Early Modeling Thought Process
- Use consulting's MECE ideology in approach to solution
- Create MECE buckets wherein countries are ranked via their "tech market attractiveness" and classified accordingly
- Classification would be ideal, *if* we had a target variable
- Ensure that we utilize all of the data available
- In this case, Supervised Learning is ***substantially*** simpler (and quicker) than Unsupervised Learning
> *The more challenging a personal project is, the more impressive the result*

### Notes
The broadness of the goal and purpose, makes the actual process of this project a bit more tedious, however I believe it will pay dividends from an output standpoint.

Objective ambiguity resolution is more difficult to display when a project is being completed purely out of one's own interest. This is indeed an underlying purpose of the project.
